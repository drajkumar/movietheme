                <h3>4.1 Price</h3>
                <p>Filmsvip reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Filmsvip will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information. Filmsvip may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Filmsvip gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Filmsvip, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Filmsvip’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.</p>

Third party services are not under Filmsvip’s control, and Filmsvip is not responsible for any third party service’s use of your exported information.

                <h3>8.4 User Content Representations and Warranties</h3>
                <p>Filmsvip disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Content. You are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of providing User Content via the Service. By providing User Content via the Service, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:</p>
                <p>a) you are the creator and owner of the User Content, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize Filmsvip and users of the Service to use and distribute your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this Section, in the manner contemplated by Filmsvip, the Service, and these Terms;</p>
                <p>b) your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Filmsvip to violate any law or regulation; and</p>

                <p>d) your User Content does not and will not contain Hateful Content, a Threat of Physical Harm, or Harassment</p>
                <p>The following serves as a guide to help illustrate generally the types of content that fall within the scope of Filmsvip’s policy on Hateful Content, Threats of Physical Harm, and Harassment, but is not exhaustive. This Section 8.4(d) does not limit any of our other rights or remedies provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, your User Content may not include, and Filmsvip may remove or refuse to publish or promote any User Content that violates the terms or policies of any third party platform with which Filmsvip’s Services integrate or interoperate.</p>
                <p>Hateful Content includes:</p>
                <p>Any statement, image, photograph, or other content that in our sole judgment could be reasonably perceived to harm, threaten, demean, promote the harassment of, promote the intimidation of, or promote the abuse of others for any reason, including by reason of race, gender or gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation, religion, or otherwise.</p>
                <p>A Threat of Physical Harm includes:</p>
                <p>Any statement, photograph, advertisement, or other content that in our sole judgment could be reasonably perceived to threaten, advocate, or incite physical harm to or violence against others, including references to current or historical figures or groups that are known for purporting such content, such as the Ku Klux Klan, Nazi Party, and the like.</p>
                <p>Harassment includes:</p>
                <p>Revealing someone’s personal information, also known as “doxxing”,online stalking, and bullying, wishes for physical harm directed at a person or persons, incitement of others to any of the previous items</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts and remove individual posts which contain Hateful Content, a Threat of Physical Harm, or Harassment. We also may suspend or terminate your account if we determine, in our sole discretion, that you are either:</p>
                <p>An organization which has publicly stated or acknowledged that its goals, objectives, positions, or founding tenets include statements or principles that could be reasonably perceived to advocate, encourage, or sponsor Hateful Content, Harassment, or A Threat of Physical Harm. A person or organization that has acted in such a way as could be reasonably perceived to support, condone, encourage, or represent Hateful Content, Harassment, or A Threat of Physical Harm.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content we find in violation of the Terms or that we find, in our sole discretion to be otherwise objectionable, at our sole discretion.</p>
                <h3>8.5 User Content Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Filmsvip may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.</p>
                <p>You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against Filmsvip with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, Filmsvip does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.</p>
                <h3>8.6 Monitoring Content</h3>
                <p>Filmsvip does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (ii) any content made available by third parties; or (iii) the use of the Service by its users. You acknowledge and agree that Filmsvip reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Service for operational and other purposes.

During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>13. Disclaimers; No Warranties</h2>
                <p>THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. Filmsvip DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, RELATING TO THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING: (A) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (B) ANY WARRANTY ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. Filmsvip DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND Filmsvip DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.</p>
                <p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR Filmsvip ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE Filmsvip ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.</p>
                <p>HOWEVER, Filmsvip DOES NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER RIGHT THAT Filmsvip IS PROHIBITED FROM DISCLAIMING UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
                <h2>14. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE Filmsvip ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY Filmsvip ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 16.4(iii) AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE Filmsvip ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO Filmsvip FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.</p>
                <p>EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS.

                <h2>15. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
                <h3>15.1 Generally</h3>
                <p>In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Filmsvip in the most expedient and cost effective manner, and except as described in Section 16.2, you and Filmsvip agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. Dispute artibration timeframes are subjected to artibrator conditions and can take up to 6 months. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND Filmsvip ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
                <h3>15.2 Exceptions</h3>
                <p>Despite the provisions of Section 16.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
                <h3>15.3 Arbitrator</h3>
                <p>Any arbitration between you and Filmsvip will be settled under the the laws of the Cyprus and any disputes will be decided only by the Cyprus courts. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
                <h2>16. General Terms</h2>
                <p>These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Filmsvip regarding your use of the Service. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                <h3>16.1 Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Cyprus without regard to conflict of law principles. You and Filmsvip submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the Cyprus for resolution of any lawsuit or court proceeding permitted under these Terms.</p>
                <h3>16.2 Consent to Electronic Communications</h3>
                <p>By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.</p>
